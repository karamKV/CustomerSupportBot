1. **SHAKEN/STIR Registration**: This protocol is designed to authenticate caller ID information and verify that it's coming from a legitimate source. It may boost answer rates with a 'Trusted Call' label, which can help in reducing the likelihood of being marked as spam.

2. **Registration Process**: The SHAKEN/STIR approval process typically takes up to 4 days. Once registered, all current and future phone numbers are automatically linked to the SHAKEN/STIR profile.

3. **Contacting Phone Provider**: As mentioned in your query, talking to your phone provider about getting 'A' attestation could be part of the SHAKEN/STIR process, which involves verifying the legitimacy of your phone number.

These steps can help improve the trustworthiness of your phone number and potentially prevent it from being flagged as spam.","[{'url': 'https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001231665-why-are-my-calls-marked-as-spam-and-how-can-i-avoid-it-lc-phone-', 'Category': 'Phone System ', 'Folder': 'Calling '}]"

Domain related issues,LC Email System,Appointments,https://help.gohighlevel.com/a/solutions/articles/155000002220?portalId=48000045315,"Here are some key points related to domain issues within the HighLevel platform:

1. **Domain Setup and Management**:
   - You can set up root domains and subdomains for funnels and websites by adding CNAME or A records in your DNS settings and associating them with your HighLevel account. [5]
   - The Domain Connect feature offers automatic DNS configuration for Google, Cloudflare, and GoDaddy domains. [2]

2. **Troubleshooting Domain Issues**:
   - If you encounter a 404 error after adding DNS records, check for duplicate A records and confirm DNS propagation. [2]
   - For SSL errors, ensure correct DNS setup and that only the correct A or CNAME record is present. [5]

3. **Domain Verification**:
   - Domain verification is crucial for email tracking and ensuring authorized sending. You can verify your domain using Auto Configure DNS or Manual Setup by adding TXT, CNAME, and MX records. [20]

4. **Common Domain Problems**:
   - If using WIX as a domain provider, you may need to change nameservers to GoDaddy for proper email functionality. [4]
   - For issues with DNS records not working in SquareSpace, use a browser other than Google Chrome to add DNS records.

2. **Check DNS Records**: Log in to your domain provider, go to DNS records, and verify the CNAME record settings.

3. **Adjust Mailgun Settings**: In Mailgun, go to Sending > Domain Settings and edit the Tracking Protocol. You may also need to enable HTTPS Tracking Links.

4. **Avoid Common Mistakes**: Ensure that you do not include the root domain in the CNAME record. Use 'email.mg' as the hostname instead of 'email.mg.yourdomain.com'.
